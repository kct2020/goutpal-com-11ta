I&#039;m very pleased you like the forum. But, to get personal help, you have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/forum/help-my-gout/#new-post&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ask in the gout forum&lt;/a&gt;.

As you can see from &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/topic/improving-uric-acid-back-pain-page/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Improving Uric Acid Back Pain Page&lt;/a&gt;, this page is now on my list of pages to review. I&#039;m not planning to include costochondritis in my review. That&#039;s because it&#039;s just one of many back conditions that might get confused with gout. I don&#039;t think there are enough people interested in costochondritis , to justify specific investigation. But, you might prove me wrong. Therefor, if you feel that I should research it more, please add your comments to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/topic/improving-uric-acid-back-pain-page/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Improving Uric Acid Back Pain Page&lt;/a&gt; suggestion. Your comments will raise the profile of that suggestion. Then, I will raise Uric Acid Back Pain priority, and improve this page faster.

As I said, if you want personal help on this issue, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/forum/help-my-gout/#new-post&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ask in the gout forum&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;m sorry if the feedback form is confusing. I&#039;m actively working on improving it, so it becomes clearer: 
The forum is for personal help for you.
The feedback form is for general comments that I can use to improve these pages.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there a relationship between gout and costochondritis? I had a gout flare up 2 weeks ago that made me wonder if i had broken my foot. The flare up ceased and a week later I developed a stabbing pain like someone had stuck a knife through my back and it came through near my sternum. Ibuprofen seemed to help just a little, with the pain returning in force every 4 hours or so. Is there a possibility uric acid would cause this issue or is it just coincidence? Thank you for this forum and the opportunity to ask questions.]]></description>

Thank you for your comment, Joanne.

I think this page should give clearer guidance. People are often unsure if their back pain is caused by gout. Or, if it is due to a different form of arthritis.

I&#039;ve flagged this page for review. I hope people add their ideas about how to make this page better. Please add replies to &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/topic/improving-uric-acid-back-pain-page/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Improving Uric Acid Back Pain Page&lt;/a&gt;.

If anyone wants personal advice about uric acid and back pain, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/forum/help-my-gout/#new-post&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;start your new topic in the gout forum&lt;/a&gt;. You can use that same link to get personal help on any aspect of your gout.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Back Pain&lt;/strong&gt;

Lower back pain feels like a large lump at base of my spine and a lump on top of my spine. Also, I&#039;ve got high levels of uric acid in my blood.

I had both knees replaced due to osteo atheritis. And, my doctor says i have gout. But hands and feet ok - no pain.]]></description>
