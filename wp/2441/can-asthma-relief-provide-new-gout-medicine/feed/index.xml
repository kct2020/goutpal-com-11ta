Thank you for your comment, Dave.

Gout patients are always looking for better ways to control gout pain, until they can get uric acid under control. I think many people will be interested to see if there are any developments in researching montelukast for gout.

I&#039;ve flagged this page for review. People can add their ideas about improving this page at &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/topic/montelukast-and-gout-review/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Montelukast and gout discussion&lt;/a&gt;.

If anyone wants personal advice about montelukast and gout, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/forum/help-my-gout/#new-post&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;start your new topic in the gout forum&lt;/a&gt;. You can use that same link to get personal help on any aspect of your gout.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had chronic asthma for years - last year I was prescribed Montelukast in addition to my preventative steroids.  

Recently I had a first gout attack-  far too much beer and meat in Germany..  I could stand the pain and even walk a bit until I got to the Doctor at home for colchicine, it quickly went down .   A second  attack subsided very quickly likewise.   

Age 65  weight 265 lbs.   

I credit Montelukast from my unscientific experience as a beneficial drug for gout.]]></description>
