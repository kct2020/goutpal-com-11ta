The most important thing you must do is to see a rheumatologist. I never heard of a podiatrist who understands gout, and I’ve heard some dangerous nonsense from more than 1. Your podiatrist’s explanation of gout and uric acid levels is a clear indication that he does not know what he is talking about.

A good rheumatologist will provide a proper diagnosis, so you can get treatment before you suffer serious joint damage, or make your kidneys worse. Certainly, anyone who suspects gout with kidney disease must see a rheumatologist. If, after conducting proper tests, your rheumatologist also suspects Morton’s Neuroma, he might refer you to a neurologist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I have had in my lifetime 3 gout attacks I guess.  I am 58 years old, a male with stage III kidney disease and recently have had I guess gout for over a month now.  

I went to a podiatrist who just looked at it after telling my story and he said I have gout.  No blood tests for uric acid levels because he said some patients have high levels and don&#039;t have gout and other have low levels and have it.  He said come back if the pain continues and he will give me a cortisone shot. 
 
But I still feel like its Morton&#039;s Neuroma and not gout.  My pad of my foot just is so tender and redness on top of my foot near the 3rd and 4th toes.  

Can anyone tell me if they have had pain this long?

Thanks,
Robby]]></description>
