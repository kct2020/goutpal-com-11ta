The most important thing you must do is to see a rheumatologist. I never heard of a podiatrist who understands gout, and I’ve heard some dangerous nonsense from more than 1. Your podiatrist’s explanation of gout and uric acid levels is a clear indication that he does not know what he is talking about.

A good rheumatologist will provide a proper diagnosis, so you can get treatment before you suffer serious joint damage, or make your kidneys worse. Certainly, anyone who suspects gout with kidney disease must see a rheumatologist. If, after conducting proper tests, your rheumatologist also suspects Morton’s Neuroma, he might refer you to a neurologist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I have had in my lifetime 3 gout attacks I guess.  I am 58 years old, a male with stage III kidney disease and recently have had I guess gout for over a month now.  

I went to a podiatrist who just looked at it after telling my story and he said I have gout.  No blood tests for uric acid levels because he said some patients have high levels and don&#039;t have gout and other have low levels and have it.  He said come back if the pain continues and he will give me a cortisone shot. 
 
But I still feel like its Morton&#039;s Neuroma and not gout.  My pad of my foot just is so tender and redness on top of my foot near the 3rd and 4th toes.  

Can anyone tell me if they have had pain this long?

Thanks,
Robby]]></description>

I&#039;m very pleased you like the forum. But, to get personal help, you have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://links.goutpal.com/p/goutpal-links-gout-discussions?a=888958067&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ask in the gout forum&lt;/a&gt;.

As you can see from &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/topic/improving-uric-acid-back-pain-page/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Improving Uric Acid Back Pain Page&lt;/a&gt;, this page is now on my list of pages to review. I&#039;m not planning to include costochondritis in my review. That&#039;s because it&#039;s just one of many back conditions that might get confused with gout. I don&#039;t think there are enough people interested in costochondritis , to justify specific investigation. But, you might prove me wrong. Therefor, if you feel that I should research it more, please add your comments to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/topic/improving-uric-acid-back-pain-page/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Improving Uric Acid Back Pain Page&lt;/a&gt; suggestion. Your comments will raise the profile of that suggestion. Then, I will raise Uric Acid Back Pain priority, and improve this page faster.

As I said, if you want personal help on this issue, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://links.goutpal.com/p/goutpal-links-gout-discussions?a=888958067&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ask in the gout forum&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;m sorry if the feedback form is confusing. I&#039;m actively working on improving it, so it becomes clearer:

					<description><![CDATA[Is there a relationship between gout and costochondritis? I had a gout flare up 2 weeks ago that made me wonder if i had broken my foot. The flare up ceased and a week later I developed a stabbing pain like someone had stuck a knife through my back and it came through near my sternum. Ibuprofen seemed to help just a little, with the pain returning in force every 4 hours or so. Is there a possibility uric acid would cause this issue or is it just coincidence? Thank you for this forum and the opportunity to ask questions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/3099/heat-or-ice-for-gout-relief/#comment-13&quot;&gt;GoutPal1&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks, Geroid.

Heat treatment isn&#039;t specific to any joint. Therefore, my short answer is &#039;Yes&#039;. But, there are many other more important issues to consider. You should only use heat treatment for gout pain in your wrist as a temporary measure. Your permanent solution is to reduce uric acid to safe levels. Then, you will not need heat treatment for your gouty joints, or any other form of pain control.

Thank you for your comment, Dave.

Gout patients are always looking for better ways to control gout pain, until they can get uric acid under control. I think many people will be interested to see if there are any developments in researching montelukast for gout.

I&#039;ve flagged this page for review. People can add their ideas about improving this page at &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/topic/montelukast-and-gout-review/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Montelukast and gout discussion&lt;/a&gt;.

If anyone wants personal advice about montelukast and gout, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://links.goutpal.com/p/goutpal-links-gout-discussions?a=888958067&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;start your new topic in the gout forum&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for your comment, Joanne.

I think this page should give clearer guidance. People are often unsure if their back pain is caused by gout. Or, if it is due to a different form of arthritis.

I&#039;ve flagged this page for review. I hope people add their ideas about how to make this page better. Please add replies to &lt;a href=&quot;http://goutpal.net/forums/topic/improving-uric-acid-back-pain-page/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Improving Uric Acid Back Pain Page&lt;/a&gt;.

Lower back pain feels like a large lump at base of my spine and a lump on top of my spine. Also, I&#039;ve got high levels of uric acid in my blood.

I had both knees replaced due to osteo atheritis. And, my doctor says i have gout. But hands and feet ok - no pain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had chronic asthma for years - last year I was prescribed Montelukast in addition to my preventative steroids.  

Recently I had a first gout attack-  far too much beer and meat in Germany..  I could stand the pain and even walk a bit until I got to the Doctor at home for colchicine, it quickly went down .   A second  attack subsided very quickly likewise.   

Age 65  weight 265 lbs.   

I credit Montelukast from my unscientific experience as a beneficial drug for gout.]]></description>
