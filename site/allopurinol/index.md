<h2 id="intro">Allopurinol Introduction</h2>
This is a hub page for all allopurinol articles. However, it might not include all allopurinol articles that are relevant to you. So you should also use the <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">{{ site.searchname }}</a> to find specific allopurinol facts. Or to find ways to resolve your allopurinol concerns.

<h2 id="intent">Allopurinol Article Audiences</h2>
Most allopurinol articles are part of GoutPal's Gout Patient Plan. Especially since allopurinol is recommended by most rheumatologists as the first-line treatment for controlling excess uric acid. This includes most side-effects articles. However fear of side-effects prevents some gout sufferers initiating uric acid treatment. Similarly poor management of allopurinol side-effects causes some gout patients to withdraw treeatment. So I include those articles in GoutPal's Gout Victim Plan.

<h2 id="type">Types of Allopurinol Article</h2>
Within each of the GoutPal Plans, I identify <a href="#facts">facts</a> and <a href="faqs">concerns</a>...

<h3 id="facts">Allopurinol Facts</h3>
These facts support recommendations and associated options within each plan. Each article identifies its specific purpose. But in general these articles identify treatment options that you should discuss with your professional health advisers.

<h3 id="faqs">Allopurinol Concerns</h3>
These are common concerns about allopurinol that other gout suffereres have identified. Often, we have identified and discussed these concerns. But remember, opinions and experiences of other gout sufferers might not be relevant to your medical situation. So you must discuss your allopurinol concerns with  professional health advisers. However, other people's experiences might help you frame those discussions.

<h2 id="next">Your Allopurinol</h2>
As you can see, I'm reorganizing, reviewing, and republishing lots of allopurinol articles. Because allopurinol affects almost every gout sufferer. Even if you don't take it. 

As a minimum, you should learn the "rules" about allopurinol planning, prescribing, and monitoring. Because most of them apply to all uric acid treatment. So allopurinol-takers need to choose the right options for their personal gout plan. Meanwhile gout sufferers choosing alternatives to allopurinol must make similar choices for their selected treatment. But all gout sufferers need to discuss those options with their professional health advisers. For example, if you are following any gout diet plan, you must monitor uric acid changes in response to eating pattern changes. Also, you have to discuss starting gout diet with a dietitian or other health professional. Then you have to adjust your uric acid targets as you progress through debulking to maintenance phase.

Importantly, most gout sufferers mix their favorite aspects of drugs, diet, and complementary medicine. So you might aim for lower allopurinol dosing in conjunction with diet changes and supplements. But you must ensure that these work in harmony by discussing your approach with qualified advisers.
