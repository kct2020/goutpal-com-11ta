## {{ site.name }} Introduction

I started GoutPal to help me learn about my gout. Because I wanted to collect facts about the best ways to control uric acid. And avoid the misinformation from companies trying to sell fake cures.

Now, I've been free from the pain of gout for several years. But I made a few mistakes along the way. Also, I wasted some time as I tried to find "the best" way to end gout pain. Rather than taking swift action. So I want to help you find quick solutions to your gout problems.

I believe that the most important first step is to build a good relationship with a suitably qualified health professional. Then you can work together to create treatment plans that work for your unique circumstances. Because gout control has some principles that apply to everyone. But many of the details change from one sufferer to the next.

## GoutPal 2021

Currently, I am changing the platform for GoutPal. So you will see a mix of old and new styles. But gradually, I will republish old pages in the new style. 

More imporantly, I'm changing my gout forums to focus more on personalizing GoutPal for you. So I recommend you follow the [Your GoutPal links](#next) below.
