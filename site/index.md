## {{ site.name }} Introduction

I started GoutPal to help me learn about my gout. Because I wanted to collect facts about the best ways to control uric acid. And avoid the misinformation from companies trying to sell fake cures.

Now, I've been free from the pain of gout for several years. But I made a few mistakes along the way. Also, I wasted some time as I tried to find "the best" way to end gout pain. Rather than taking swift action. So I want to help you find quick solutions to your gout problems.

I believe that the most important first step is to build a good relationship with a suitably qualified health professional. Then you can work together to create treatment plans that work for your unique circumstances. Because gout control has some principles that apply to everyone. But many of the details change from one sufferer to the next.

## GoutPal 2021

Currently, I am changing the platform for GoutPal. So you will see a mix of old and new styles. But gradually, I will republish old pages in the new style. 

More imporantly, I'm changing my gout forums to focus more on personalizing GoutPal for you. So I recommend you follow the [Your GoutPal links](#next) below.

<h2 id="next">Your GoutPal</h2>

I'm happy with my own gout control now. So I'm focused on making GoutPal the best place to help you. But to do that, I need your feedback.

This page is under review at <a href="https://keithctaylor.gumroad.com/l/mkpxbm?a=888958067">GoutPal User Documentation Project</a>. So you should join that project if you want access to:
- Content improvements prior to publication
- Research materials
- Additional project notes, links, and files

Also, you can contribute to the research team if you wish. However, you can still have your say in the feedback section below. Because it is your questions, experiences, and opinions that drive GoutPal to be a better resource for all gout sufferers.
