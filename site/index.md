## {{ site.name }} Introduction

I started GoutPal to help me learn about my gout. Because I wanted to collect facts about the best ways to control uric acid. And avoid the misinformation from companies trying to sell fake cures.

Now, I've been free from the pain of gout for several years. But I made a few mistakes along the way. Also, I wasted some time as I tried to find "the best" way to end gout pain. Rather than taking swift action. So I want to help you find quick solutions to your gout problems.

I believe that the most important first step is to build a good relationship with a suitably qualified health professional. Then you can work together to create treatment plans that work for your unique circumstances. Because gout control has some principles that apply to everyone. But many of the details change from one sufferer to the next.

<p>To help you find information that is most relevant to you, I organize GoutPal using 7 phases of gout progression. So you should start with my introduction to <a href="/blog/gout-progression/">Gout Progression Phases</a>. Or go straight to the phase that seems most relevant to you today:

<h2 id="2021">GoutPal 2021</h2>
Currently, I am changing the platform for GoutPal. So you will see a mix of old and new styles. But gradually, I will republish old pages in the new style. 

Earlier, GoutPal had the following sections:
1. <a href="/gout-symptoms/">Gout Symptoms, Causes, & Diagnosis</a>
2. <a href="/gout-treatment/">Gout Treatment, Cures, Remedies & Relief</a>
3. <a href="/gout-diet/">Gout Diet Including Food, Drink & Lifestyle</a>
4. <a href="/uric-acid/">Uric Acid Step By Step</a>

But I am moving content from those sections to the Gout Progression Phases listed above. You can also find important gout and uric acid information on the following pages:

<h4 id="blog">Latest Gout Blog</h4><p>For the latest gouty arthritis facts, see the <a href="/blog">{{ site.blog }}</a>.</p>
<h4 id="old">2020 Gout Blog</h4><p>For earlier gout news see <a href="/gout-blog/">GoutPal 2020 Blog</a>.</p>
<h4 id="home">2020 GoutPal Home Page</h4><p>For the previous version of this page see <a href="/goutpal-com-2020.html">2020 home page</a>.</p>
<h4 id="search">GoutPal Search Engine</h4><p>This is the easiest way for you to answer any gout question. Just type your question or concern into the <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">{{ site.searchname }}</a>.</p>

<h2 id="next">Your GoutPal</h2>

Throughout GoutPal, you will see highlights like this that provide extra information. And act as examples of how you can add your own notes to help you manage your gout recovery plan

I'm happy with my own gout control now. So I'm focused on making GoutPal the best place to help you. But to do that, I need <a href="https://links.goutpal.com/p/goutpal-links-gout-discussions?a=888958067">your feedback</a>.
