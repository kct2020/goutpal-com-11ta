<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
During my research into butternut squash, I learned that beta-carotene can help reduce uric acid. Though, we need much more research before it can be recognized as a professional treatment. However, gout sufferers who cannot tolerate mainstream uric acid treatment need to find alternatives. So if you're considering beta-carotene for gout, here is a short list of beta-carotene rich foods. Which you and your health advisers might use to agree changes to your beta-carotene intake.

<h2 id="food">Beta-Carotene Foods for Gout Sufferers</h2>
Before my beta-carotene foods list, I will explain some facts about my presentation. Or, you can skip down to my <a href="#list">list of top beta-carotene foods for gout sufferers</a>.

As far as I am aware, there are no dietary recommendations for beta-carotene. However, the National Institutes of Health fact sheet for vitamin A gives adult allowances between 700 mcg RAE and 1,300 mcg RAE depending on age, gender, and maternal health factors<a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. But you must clarify your personal allowance with your doctor or other qualified health professional.

In any case, the fact sheet explains that 1 mcg retinol activity equivalents (RAE) is equivalent to 12 mcg dietary beta-carotene. Which is important, because the corresponding beta-carotene food content list from USDA shows values as mcg dietary beta-carotene<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. So, you can divide these by 12 if you need the vitamin A equivalent.

The complete list is useful. But it contains many similar versions of the same food. So given that food databases supply average values, I believe a curated list is more useful. Similarly, I simplify values to the nearest 1,000.

Many other foods contain lower amounts of beta-carotene. So I plan to create lists organized into food groups. Because that makes choosing between foods easier. Assuming that you plan food intake by food group. In which case, you might <a href="https://links.goutpal.com/l/wqmwjs?wanted=true&amp;price=0">subscribe to GoutPal Links Newsletter</a> to be notified when I publish more detailed beta-carotene lists.

Sweet Potato and Spinach Curry is a candidate for GoutPal's Gout Foundation Diet. But first, I need to analyze each ingredient for its impact on uric acid and gout. So in the meantime, you should check the details with your professional health advisers.
