## {{ site.name }} Status

Starting in November 2021, I'm revising old content and moving it to my new [Gout Blog](/blog/). But mostly, I'll be adding new content for:

* Replacement GoutPal Plans - you can see the start of this in Gout Maze - New Ways To Unravel Old Gout Concerns.
* New Gout Food Database - linking foods you need or those you want to avoid with the latest healthy eating guidelines.
* Your Gout Projects - templates to help you start your own gout management project.

As always, I will back my opinions and recommendations with published gout facts. So you can see that I have also revamped the Gout and Uric Acid Library. Now with simpler reviews to help you discuss your responsibilities with your professional health advisers.

## New Gout Forum Trials

I'm in the very early days of reviewing a new gout forum. As part of my changing technical platform, I expect this new format to be more efficient. But the real test is how it helps you as a gout sufferer. So please call into <a href="{{ site.social_links.github }}discussions">GoutPal's Gout Discussions</a>. And let me know what you think.

## Your {{ site.name }}

I hope you'll enjoy my {{ site.subject }} articles. Please share and discuss them with your professional advisers, where appropriate.

I hope you'll tell me if you want clarification. Or if you want me to add any {{ site.subject }} articles that I haven't included. First, check to see if we are already discussing your concerns in <a href="{{ site.social_links.github }}issues">{{ site.name }} Issues</a>. If not, <a href="{{ site.social_links.github }}issues/new/choose">raise a new issue</a> to share your questions, experiences, and opinions.
