<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
When recipes tell you to discard marrow seeds, do you follow instructions? Or do you worry that you're throwing away a helpful gout food?

Note that marrow (Cucurbita pepo L.) is also called pumpkin and summer squash. So you should search for those foods for more information.

<h2 id="intent">{{ title }} Purpose</h2>
<a href="/9569/goutpal-plan-for-gout-foodies/">GoutPal Foodies</a> learn to establish good eating patterns. Because following sound nutrition principles is the foundation for gout-friendly meal planning. Then you can build on that foundation as a <a href="/9601/goutpal-plan-for-gout-dieters/">GoutPal Dieter</a>. By changing foods and preparation techniques that are shown to lower uric acid. So this article explains how marrow seeds can be gout-friendly. But remember to discuss diet changes with your doctor before you make them.

<h2 id="marrow">{{ title }}</h2>
Most marrow recipes include instructions to remove and discard the seeds. Because it's felt that the texture of the membranes surrounding the seeds is unpleasant. Though I saw a mention on BBC Good Food website that the seeds could be fried and frozen. To serve with mashed potato another day.

A 2015 study<a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> leads me to think that gout sufferers might follow that advice. Because it shows that marrow seeds are effective in reducing uric acid levels. Although, like many studies, the effects are on poisoned rats instead of human gout sufferers.

The experiments compare marrow (Cucurbita pepo L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and prickly pear (Opuntia indica) seeds. Where all rats received the same base diet. With some groups also treated with one or all of the seeds. Then the results show the following reductions compared to the untreated group:<ol>
<li>Marrow seeds 37.50% reduction</li>
<li>Lettuce seeds 30.83% reduction</li>
<li>Prickly pear seeds 14.17% reduction</li>
<li>Equal parts mixture 10.83% reduction</li>
</ol>

Besides uric acid, the study included  other liver and kidney functions, blood lipid profiles and blood sugar. And it concluded that all seeds, and the mixture, improved all tested blood factors.

<h2 id="next">Marrow Seeds for Your Gout</h2>
You have learned how marrow seeds lower uric acid. So you might include them in your meal preparation. But be sensible in the amount of marrow seeds you include. Because your total consumption of seeds shouldn't exceed dietary guidelines. Also, you should include a variety of seeds to cover a wide range of nutrients.

Stuffed marrow is a candidate for GoutPal's Gout Foundation Diet. But first, I need to analyze each ingredient for its impact on uric acid and gout. So in the meantime, you should check the details with your professional health advisers.
