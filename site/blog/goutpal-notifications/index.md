The choice is yours. Because you can subscribe to as many GoutPal Contributor update services as you like â€“ they are all free. So, if you want to know more, read on.

Please note, I am preparing new explanations of email and web push notification services. In the meantime, here are the subscription links:

I use Gumroad to provide updates about new and revised gout articles. So if you are concerned about your email address privacy, you should know that this is a safe, secure, system with the highest privacy standards. 

Furthermore, I never see your subscription details. So I don't even know you exist. Unless you share your ideas in a forum or message. But if you want to know more, read <a href="https://gumroad.com/privacy">Gumroad Privacy Policy</a>.
