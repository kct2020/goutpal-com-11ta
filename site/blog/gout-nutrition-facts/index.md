<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
You want to know which food is good or bad for gout. But what about other diseases and your general wellbeing? Get gout nutrition facts to ensure your eating pattern covers all you need. And help your gout in the process.

<h2 id="intent">{{ title }} Purpose</h2>
I wrote this to help <a href="/9569/goutpal-plan-for-gout-foodies/">GoutPal Foodies</a> and <a href="/9601/goutpal-plan-for-gout-dieters/">GoutPal Dieters</a> understand their food choices. Because that helps you discuss your dietary requirements with health advisers.

<h2 id="nutrition">{{ title }}</h2>
Every day, gout sufferers ask, "is food good or bad for gout". Where "food" can be replaced by just about anything we eat or drink. But gout, or more specifically uric acid, changes according to our total food intake. Not one individual food item. So my approach is to explain the nutrition facts about the food in question. Then you can compare that food to alternatives. In that way, the question becomes "is 'food a' better than 'food b' for lowering uric acid".

Unfortunately, there is little help from professional gout guidelines for anyone wanting to improve their lifestyle. Because the small section of the rheumatology guideline only has conditional recommendations to limit alcohol, purine, and high-fructose corn syrup intake. One more conditional recommendation is weight loss for patients who are overweight or obese. Finally, they conditionally recommend against vitamin C supplementation (for the purpose of treating gout). With the explanation that <q cite="https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.24180">Dietary modifications likely yield only small changes in SU [serum urate] concentration<a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></q>

So for each food, I collect facts about nutrients that might affect uric acid or inflammation. Together with any scientific studies about the food's effect on gout.

<h3 id="dga">Dietary Guidelines Nutrition Facts</h3>
Whatever the scientific studies say about individual foods, it is vital that your eating patterns provide all the balanced nutrition that you need. Hence, I base most of my nutrition facts on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)<a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and associated USDA nutrition databases. Describing food groups, weekly or daily allowances, and optional Special Considerations:

<h4 id="group">DGA Food Group</h4>
Identifying the <a href="https://alkascore.com/dietary-guidelines-food-groups/">DGA Food Group</a> for each food that concerns you is a good first step. Because it allows you to see what part that food plays. So that you can find appropriate alternatives.

<h4 id="allowance">Weekly/Daily Allowance</h4>
For each food group, DGA lists daily or weekly amounts of food for your situation. Based on age, gender, and preferred eating style. I use a 2,000-calorie Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern as an example. But you need to see what your needs are. This gives you a context for individual foods that allows you to make better choices. E.g., if you're asking about chicken, you can judge it against your allowance for `Meat, Poultry, & Eggs`. Which for my eating pattern is 26 oz per week. However, I would not eat the full group allowance of a single food item. Because a key dietary principle from the guidelines tells us that food variety gives a better balance of nutrients: <br /><q cite="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf">CHOOSE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FROM EACH FOOD GROUP<br />
Enjoy different foods and beverages within each food group. This can help meet nutrient needs</q>

<h4 id="special">Special Considerations</h4>
Where the guidelines include special considerations for certain foods or groups, I include this in the food nutrition facts. E.g., for chicken:<q cite="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf"> Most intake of meats and poultry should be from fresh, frozen, or canned, and in lean forms (e.g., chicken breast or ground turkey) versus processed meats (e.g., hot dogs, sausages, ham, luncheon meats). </q>

<h3 id="food">Food & Nutrition Science</h3>

I include any studies about the food affecting uric acid or gout pain. Also, I include data about nutrients that affect uric acid:
- purines
- vitamin C
- iron
- protein
- PRAL
- <a href="/blog/beta-carotene-foods-gout/">beta-carotene</a>
- vitamin A
- quercetin
- anthocyanins
- luteolin

I'm currently investigating micronutrients with a view to updating some of those food lists and adding new ones. So please see the feedback link below to check my progress on these planned updates.
