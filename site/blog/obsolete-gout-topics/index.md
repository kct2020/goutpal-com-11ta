<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>

After a certain time, some gout topics become obsolete. Because:
- The information is superseded by newer topics.
- There is no interest in the topic.

When this happens, I usually redirect readers to the best alternative information. However, some topics have no related information. So I add them to the list below.

<h2 id="topics">{{ title }}</h2>
The 'Status' column means:
<ul>
<li>Active - there is an active GoutPal Issue for the topic.</li>
<li>Inactive - there are some additional notes about the deleted page. But they will be deleted after 1 year. Unless any reader asks for more time.</li>
<li>Archived - a link to a copy of the deleted page.</li>
</ul>
<table id="list" style="width: 100%;">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th style="width: 30%;">Title</th>
			<th style="width: 60%;">Description</th>

<h2 id="summary">{{ title }} Summary</h2>
What you've learned. Re-emphasize key facts in memorable ways.

<h2 id="next">Your {{ title }}</h2>
Now you know the status of your obsolete gout topic. But first, you should <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">search for that topic</a>. Because that is the best way to find the most relevant information.

Beyond that, your next step depends on the status of the obsolete page:<ul>
<li>Active: Add your comments at the link above. Or watch that GoutPal Issue until someone adds information that helps you.</li>
<li>Inactive: Add your questions, experiences, or opinions at the link above. Because that should reactivate the topic. Which saves unpublished research notes from being deleted.</li>
<li>Archived: Read the original version at the 'Archived' link above. That is the only information available. Because any other PDFs and research notes are deleted.</li>
</ul>

If you still have concerns about {{ topic }}, you should discuss those concerns with your professional health advisers. However, if you want help to prepare for that discussion, please see the <a href="#feedback">feedback section</a> below.
