<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>

After a certain time, some gout topics become obsolete. Because:
- Newer topicsÂ have superseded the oldÂ information.
- There is no interest in the topic.

When this happens, I usually redirect readers to the best alternative information. However, some topics have no related information. So I add them to the list below.

<h2 id="topics">{{ title }}</h2>
The 'Status' column means:
<ul>
<li>Active â€“ there is an active GoutPal Issue for the topic.</li>
<li>Inactive â€“ there are some additional notes about the deleted page. But they will be deleted after 1 year. Unless any reader asks for more time.</li>
<li>Archived â€“ a link to a copy of the deleted page.</li>
</ul>
<table id="list" style="width: 100%;">

<h2 id="next">Your {{ title }}</h2>
Now you know the status of your obsolete gout topic. But first, you should <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">search for that topic</a>. Because that is the best way to find the most relevant information.

Beyond that, your next step depends on the status of the obsolete page:<ul>
<li>Active: Add your comments at the link above. Or watch that GoutPal Issue until someone adds information that helps you.</li>
<li>Inactive: Add your questions, experiences, or opinions at the link above. Because that should reactivate the topic. Which saves unpublished research notes from being deleted.</li>
<li>Archived: Read the original version at the 'Archived' link above. That is the only information available. BecauseÂ I have deletedÂ any other PDFs and research notes.</li>
</ul>

This page is under review at <a href="https://keithctaylor.gumroad.com/l/mkpxbm?a=888958067">GoutPal User Documentation Project</a>. So you should join that project if you want access to:
- Content improvements prior to publication
- Research materials
- Additional project notes, links, and files

Also, you can contribute to the research team if you wish. However, you can still have your say in the feedback section below. Because it is your questions, experiences, and opinions that drive GoutPal to be a better resource for all gout sufferers.
