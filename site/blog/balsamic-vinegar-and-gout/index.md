<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
Balsamic vinegar forms a small part of our food intake. But we gout sufferers tend to worry about everything we eat and drink. So it's good to seek reassurance about the effects of balsamic vinegar on uric acid and gout.

<h2 id="intent">{{ title }} Purpose</h2>
<a href="/9569/goutpal-plan-for-gout-foodies/">GoutPal Foodies</a> learn to establish good eating patterns. Because following sound nutrition principles is the foundation for gout-friendly meal planning. Then you can build on that foundation as a <a href="/9601/goutpal-plan-for-gout-dieters/">GoutPal Dieter</a>. By choosing foods that are shown to lower uric acid. So this article explains how balsamic vinegar can be part of your gout-friendly eating patterns. But remember to discuss diet changes with your doctor before you make them.

<h2 id="science">Balsamic Vinegar and Gout Science</h2>
I'm unaware of any clinical trials for balsamic vinegar as a gout treatment. However, there are a few studies with uric acid data. So these summaries should give you and your doctor enough information to determine reasonable amounts of balsamic vinegar to include in your weekly meal plans.

<h3 id="purines">Is Balsamic Vinegar High in Purines?</h3>
Despite extensive research, I cannot find purine values for balsamic vinegar. But I found one study that adjustments a moderate-high purine eating pattern<a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. In order to create a low purine version. Now, that study includes balsamic vinegar in both versions. Implying that it is not high in purines. On the other hand, it might imply that the authors, like me, do not know the purine content of balsamic vinegar. In any case, a typical small serving size for balsamic vinegar means it will not have a significant effect on total purine intake. Also, purine metabolism is very complicated. So it is preferable to consider the effects of balsamic vinegar on blood uric acid levels…

<h3 id="bad">Is Balsamic Vinegar Bad for Gout?</h3>
My first uric acid study includes balsamic vinegar<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Comparing it with 2 other types of vinegar. And with a water-based garlic extract. So it shows that balsamic vinegar is more effective than apple vinegar for uric acid reduction in obese rats. However, garlic vinegar was the best of 3 types of vinegar. And garlic extract diluted with water was more effective than vinegar.

So balsamic vinegar is not bad for gout. However, you might also consider other salad dressing ingredients.

<h3 id="gout">Balsamic Vinegar & Uric Acid Study</h3>
In my second uric acid study, researchers treated groups of obese rats with balsamic vinegar solution at different strengths<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. After 6 weeks, blood tests revealed that balsamic vinegar treatment reduces uric acid in a dose-dependent manner.<br />
<q cite="https://dx.doi.org/10.21608/jedu.2022.121019.1601">the results obtained indicated that serum urea, creatinine and uric acid gradually decreased significantly at (p &lt; 0.05) for all treated groups (3,4 and 5) compared to the positive group (2) (untreated group fed on high-fat diet)</q>

<h3 id="good">Is Balsamic Vinegar Good for Gout?</h3>
Refreshingly, my final study is on humans<a href="#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Though not specifically gout sufferers. However, the researchers recorded uric acid levels before, and after 8 weeks of treatment. More importantly, they used a comparison treatment of 15 ml balsamic vinegar per day in the Control Group.
<q cite="https://doi.org/10.3793/jaam.4.1">The Control Group showed a significant decrease […] from 5.62±1.79 to 5.25±1.63 mg/dl (–5.80%, p=0.007) for uric acid.</q><br />
So we really need clinical trials with gout sufferers for more information. Because that would help you and your doctor determine how to incorporate balsamic vinegar in your treatment plan. For example, what the best dose is for your gout.

<h2 id="next">Balsamic Vinegar and Your Gout</h2>
You have learned that balsamic vinegar is probably good for gout. But we require more research to be certain. So discuss balsamic vinegar with your doctor to agree what is a reasonable amount to consume in your circumstances.  Also, consider additional gout-friendly ingredients in your <a href="/2519/dressed-up-food-good-for-gout/">salad dressing for gout</a>. Such as ground garlic and garlic vinegar.
