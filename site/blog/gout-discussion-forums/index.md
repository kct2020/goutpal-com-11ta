## Gout Forums History

Soon after starting GoutPal, I realized I needed a forum to discuss gout with fellow sufferers. But my earliest platform didn't support discussions. So I started a separate forum.

In it's heyday, GoutPal Interactive helped thousands of gout sufferers every year. Which was especially useful. As there were no official gout guidelines at the time. But now we have guidelines that emphasize discussion between doctor and gout patient. Making gout sufferers need ways to research and discuss their options. So I've created new tools to help patients and physicians understand their roles in managing gout.

Along the way, I had to change the software several times. Until the original gout forum became inoperable. So I switched to the current gout forum. But now, advances in technology force me to adopt a new gout discussion strategy. However, the old forums contain a wealth of questions, experiences, and opinions. Most of which are still relevant to the new ways of managing gout.

Now, I am merging that history into this website. Giving you the chance to see how other sufferers resolve their gout concerns.

## Original Gout Forum

Today, I've merged the original gout forum here. So this page serves as an index for finding relevant gout forum posts. Also, it serves as a plan for improving those posts. As I reformat important topics. Underlining their relevance to the latest best practices for gout management.

I should point out that I recently started to remodel the old forum as my story of GoutPal. But I never got far with that. So you might ignore any references to "Keith's GoutPal Story". Instead, you should focus on:

- <a href="/gout-pal-forum/">GoutPal's Original Gout Forum</a>. A traditional form of online forum posts. Presented in a date-sequenced list.
- <a href="/gout-news/">Gout Discussions and Summaries</a>. A collection of articles by myself and other gout sufferers. Including many with extensive discussion about important gout concerns.

For completeness, here is a link to the <a href="/keiths-gout-story-2020.html">original gout forum home page</a>.

## Using The Gout Forum

Here in the main gout website, there are several articles that refer to using the gout forum. Including personal research for management plans. Or just about how to share thoughts with other gout sufferers. So here is a list of relevant articles that refer to using the gout forum.

Note that these are references to using (or how to use) different gout forums. Rather than actual gout discussions. This summary replaces many forum and discussion pages. But if you are interested in specific gout topic forums, see the gout forum archives #ref1-nn

- 2021 GoutPal Forum. Still active, but merging soon.
- <a href="/topic/forum/">Forum Tag</a>.
