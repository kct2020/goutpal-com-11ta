<p>To help you play your part in that partnership, I have gathered many facts about gout &amp; bread. In my list below, I include the most appropriate gout progression phase. So that you can focus on the gout &amp; bread facts that are most relevant to you today.</p>

<p>Please note that the list above includes pages from two decades of my gout research. So I might not have reviewed them for recent scientific advances. In any event, they are all suggestions of studies that you might discuss with your doctor.  Because you must rely on medical expertise from a professional who has studied your case history.</p>
<p>However, I would appreciate it if you let me know of any pages that I need to review and update.</p>

<p>Now, you can start collecting studies that help you and your doctor manage your bread consumption. So I recommend that you create a list of these studies using the annotation features on this page. Also, think about other food items that you regularly eat with bread. Then search GoutPal for facts about those foods and add relevant studies to your list.</p>
