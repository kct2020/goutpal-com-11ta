<h2 id="intro">Ground Beef & Gout Introduction</h2>

<h2 id="intent">Purpose of Ground Beef & Gout</h2>

This is to help GoutPal Foodies understand how their food preferences relate to gout. So it does not consider uric acid which is covered in GoutPal Dieter Plans. You can use this information to discuss ground beef with your dietitian or other health professional.

You should now see there is no need to discuss ground beef with your dietitian or other health professional. Because total meat consumption is more important than specific cuts of meat. Especially red meat consumption. So if your ground beef consumption exceeds national guidelines, you should reduce it. But if you are already limiting meat intake to national guidelines then you should start discussing other food groups with your dietitian.

Please note that I am considering summarizing national guidelines for healthy eating patterns. Because that will allow you to prepare better gout questions about your food intake. So please tell me what would help you most.
